## Touchscreen Flip Mount for BigTreeTech Pi TFT4.3
This is a remix based on the [Waveshare 4.3 touchscreen mount](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/jeoje/4.3_Inch_Touchscreen_Mount/STL/2.4) by jeoje. 

This mount does NOT require rotating the scree via the configuration, however the brightness buttons are not accesible with the normal mount.  The thick mount will allow access with a pointy device.

Print the faceplate in the accent colour of your choice. The mount uses M3 brass heatset inserts and M3x8(or M3x10) screws to fasten the faceplate on each side. 
Use the screws provided in the BTT touchscreen packaging to fasten the screen to the mount.

### Fastener Count  
- 4 M2.5x6 (included with BTT screen)
- 5 M3x8 
- 3 M3 roll-in nut
- 2 M3 heatset insert
